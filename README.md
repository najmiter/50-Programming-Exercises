# 50 Programming Exercises
Skills such as programming are only possible to gain via practice. Of course, you learn from books and lectures but if there's no implementation of what you learn, no matter how good you are at learning and remembering your lesson, it will just fade out.

So, I assembled these 50+ programming exercises for beginners with their solutions explained in detail in Urdu / Hindi. This kind of activity will force to become a better and better programmer until eventually, you become an expert.

I highly recommend that you (try to) solve each problem by yourself before watching me solve it first. Then compare your solution with mine (and maybe yours would be better üòâ)

I have used C++ as the tool to solve these programming problems because it's the best language for this sort of thing (which is just an opinion of mine). But you can do these exercises in whatever language you are using; Python, Java, JavaScript, or any other. The main goal of these problems is to help you develop your logic building skills and it doesn't matter which tool you're using. I already told which tool is better from my personal experience. ‚úåÔ∏è
