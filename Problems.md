# 50 Programming Problems for Beginners

## Problem #01
Write a `C++` program to loop through 1 to 100. Then print `“fizz”` if the number is divisible by `3`, print `“buzz”` if the number is divisible by `5`, and print `“fizzbuzz”` if the number is divisible by both `3` and `5`. Otherwise just print the number.
## Problem #02
Given a `string`, calculate the total number vowels in the `string`.
## Problem #03
Given any number, print its table of multiplication.
## Problem #04
Generate a random number and store it in a variable called `secret`. Then give the user `5` attempts to guess that number. If the user guesses it, print `"You WON!"`. Otherwise print `"You LOST!"`. For simplicity, the random number must only be between `0 and 10` inclusive.
## Problem #05
Reverse any given `string` and store the result in the same variable.
## Problem #06
Write a `C++` program that will find a given character from any given `string`. If the character occurs more than once, you must only return the first occurrence’s `index`.
## Problem #07
Write a `C++` program that takes a character and finds that character in the `string` using the function implemented in Problem #06 and removes that character from the `string`.
