# 50 Programming Problems for Beginners

## Problem #01
Write a `C++` program to loop through 1 to 100. Then print `“fizz”` if the number is divisible by `3`, print `“buzz”` if the number is divisible by `5`, and print `“fizzbuzz”` if the number is divisible by both `3` and `5`. Otherwise just print the number.
## Problem #02
Given a `string`, calculate the total number vowels in the `string`.
## Problem #03
Given any number, print its table of multiplication.
## Problem #04
Generate a random number and store it in a variable called `secret`. Then give the user `5` attempts to guess that number. If the user guesses it, print `"You WON!"`. Otherwise print `"You LOST!"`. For simplicity, the random number must only be between `0 and 10` inclusive.
## Problem #05
Reverse any given `string` and store the result in the same variable.
## Problem #06
Write a `C++` program that will find a given character from any given `string`. If the character occurs more than once, you must only return the first occurrence’s `index`.
## Problem #07
Write a `C++` program that takes a character and finds that character in the `string` using the function implemented in Problem #06 and removes that character from the `string`.
## Problem #08
Write a `C++` program that takes two `string` objects and compares them. It should `return true` if they are the same and `false` otherwise.
## Problem #09
Given any `string`, calculate the total number of words in the `string`.
## Problem #10
Write a `C++` program that converts lower-case characters in a `string` to upper-case chars and upper-case chars to lower-case.
## Problem #11
Write a `C++` program to check if a number is `prime` or not. Then write another function that takes boundaries and prints all the prime numbers between those boundaries.
## Problem #12
Write a `C++` program that prints the `nth` term of the `Fibonacci Series`. Then write another function that prints the first `n` terms of the `Fibonacci Series`.
## Problem #13
Write a `C++` program to print the following `star patterns` on the terminal using `loops`.

## Problem #14
Implement a `C++` function that generates a `substring`. The behaivor of this function should mimic the built-in `substr` function in the `Standard Library`.
## Problem #15
Write a `C++` program that copies an `array` into another and the order can be the original or it can be reverse. You will ask the caller of the function how they want to copy it. Default would be as it is.
## Problem #16
Write a `C++` program that counts the number of even/odd numbers in an `array`. Another function would copy the elements of the array into another. (Only even or odds. Default would be even).
## Problem #17
Write a `C++` program that `squares` each element of the `array` and stores the values into another array with the original values. For example, if the array was `{2, 4, 7, 3}`, your program should produce an array that looks like, `{2, 4, 4, 16, 7, 49, 3, 9}`.
## Problem #18
Implement a `C++` program that generates `random numbers` that are between `0 and 100` inclusive. Your program should print the numbers on the console until a `prime number` is generated. (Use the prime number checker you have already implemented.)
## Problem #19
Write a `C++` function that generates a `random string` that looks like a `Google Meet ID`. For example, `abc-defg-hij`.
## Problem #20
Write a `C++` program that `swaps` the values of two variables using *temporary* variable. Then do it *without* using the `temp` variable.
## Problem #21
Implement a `C++` function that *returns* the `sum` of all the elements of an `array`. Write another function that multiplies all the elements.
## Problem #22
Implement a `C++` function that returns the `largest` element in the `array`. Give the option to the caller to find the largest or the `smallest`. By default, find the largest.
## Problem #23
Write a `C++` program that checks if an *`array` is sorted or not*. By default, it will check for *ascending* order, but you have to give the option to the caller to change that to descending.
## Problem #24
Write a `C++` program that, given a `string`, prints the **ASCII** values of each character. Then write another function that will print the character only if its ASCII value is **even**.
## Problem #25
Implement a `C++` function that takes a `string` as an input and checks if the `string` **contains a valid number or not**. For example, `“12345”` is a valid number. Whereas, `“123a45”` is not.
