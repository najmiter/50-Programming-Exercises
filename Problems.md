# 50 Programming Problems for Beginners

## Problem #01
Write a `C++` program to loop through 1 to 100. Then print `“fizz”` if the number is divisible by `3`, print `“buzz”` if the number is divisible by `5`, and print `“fizzbuzz”` if the number is divisible by both `3` and `5`. Otherwise just print the number.
## Problem #02
Given a `string`, calculate the total number vowels in the `string`.
## Problem #03
Given any number, print its table of multiplication.
## Problem #04
Generate a random number and store it in a variable called `secret`. Then give the user `5` attempts to guess that number. If the user guesses it, print `"You WON!"`. Otherwise print `"You LOST!"`. For simplicity, the random number must only be between `0 and 10` inclusive.
## Problem #05
Reverse any given `string` and store the result in the same variable.
## Problem #06
Write a `C++` program that will find a given character from any given `string`. If the character occurs more than once, you must only return the first occurrence’s `index`.
## Problem #07
Write a `C++` program that takes a character and finds that character in the `string` using the function implemented in Problem #06 and removes that character from the `string`.
## Problem #08
Write a `C++` program that takes two `string` objects and compares them. It should `return true` if they are the same and `false` otherwise.
## Problem #09
Given any `string`, calculate the total number of words in the `string`.
## Problem #10
Write a `C++` program that converts lower-case characters in a `string` to upper-case chars and upper-case chars to lower-case.
## Problem #11
Write a `C++` program to check if a number is `prime` or not. Then write another function that takes boundaries and prints all the prime numbers between those boundaries.
## Problem #12
Write a `C++` program that prints the `nth` term of the `Fibonacci Series`. Then write another function that prints the first `n` terms of the `Fibonacci Series`.
